*👋 Hi, I’m @suwe-dev, a passionate web developer.

*👀 I specialize in Backend development, particularly with Python (Flask RESTful APIs) and Java (Spring Boot - RESTful APIs).

*🌱 Currently, I'm deepening my knowledge in Backend development with Java, specifically focusing on the Spring framework and Spring Boot.

*💼 Proficient in working with databases, I have experience with PostgreSQL and MySQL, utilizing ORM (SQLAlchemy) for efficient data management.

*🥳 I'm excited about my ongoing journey in software development and am currently immersing myself in the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js), broadening my skill set.

*💞️ Always open to collaboration, I'm keen to contribute to Backend development and open-source projects.

*📫 Feel free to contact me at suwethan.dev@outlook.com.
